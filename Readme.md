# Emotion Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a robust emotion classifier using textual data. The model is trained to recognize and classify various emotions expressed in text, leveraging powerful machine learning techniques. A Streamlit app is also developed to demonstrate the model in action.

## üöÄ Workflow / Approach

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removal of duplicates
  - Data balancing

- **Text Cleaning**:
  - Punctuation and emoji removal using **NeatText**
  - Stopword removal and Lemmatization using **NLTK**

- **Train-Test Split**

- **Vectorization**:
  - TF-IDF Vectorizer

### 2. **Model Development**

Two machine learning algorithms were trained and compared:

- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** with different regularization parameters:
  - `C = 0.1` *(best performing)*
  - `C = 1.0`
- **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes**

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

### 4. **Model Saving**
- The best model is saved for deployment in a web application.

### 5. **Deployment**
- The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit** for user interaction and emotion prediction.
